\subsection{LDA topic model} \label{results_topic_model}

As discussed in section \ref{data}, we ended up with a corpus of 7,386 abstracts. During the pre-processing of our text data, we removed some neutral words that came up frequently, such as ``migration", ``migrant", ``migrants", ``mobility", ``article", ``paper", ``study", ``research", and ``analysis". Additionally, we defined the following multi-word expressions we wanted to treat as a single term: ``human capital", ``brain drain", ``brain gain", ``foreign direct investment", ``european union", ``united states", ``united kingdom", ``climate change", ``health care", ``asylum seeker". This is an important step, because otherwise the algorithm would break these multi-word expressions in single words (``human capital" would be broken in ``human" and ``capital").

After pre-processing our data and creating the DTM, we decided trim the terms that appeared less than 10 times, in order to keep only the most essential words that could be identified as being part of a topic. In the end, we were left with 3,748 words, which formed our fixed vocabulary. With that in hand, we estimated our LDA topic model with $K = 26$ topics\footnote{We also estimated models with 27, 28, and 29 topics, but the inclusion of additional topics yielded no results other than introducing seemingly meaningless topics. Therefore, we opted for the parsimony of a smaller number of topics.}, and $\alpha = \frac{1}{K} \Leftrightarrow \alpha = 0.038$, which is a value that tells the algorithm that each document will be composed by a smaller number of very high-probability topics. For $\eta$\footnote{Just for the record, \textit{topicmodels} uses $\beta$ to define what we refer to here as $\eta$. In fact, this change in the notation of this hyperparameter is not unusual, as seen in \cite{ponweiser_latent_2012}.}, we used the default value of 0.1 given by the \textit{topicmodels}'s function \textit{LDA}. 

Tables \ref{tab:top_terms_1} and \ref{tab:top_terms_2} present the fifteen most likely terms from our 26 topics, which were taken from the \textit{matrix of per-topic word probabilities}. As mentioned in section \ref{topic_modelling}, LDA topic modelling is unable to assess and interpret topics qualitatively, meaning that it is one of our tasks to label the topics. To do that, we used a joint strategy of checking the twenty words with the highest probability in each topic and checking the ten works that are most likely to belong to each topic. We present the labels for the 26 topics in table \ref{tab:topics_labels}.

\label{tab:topics_labels}
\end{table}

We will not address all the topics, but some comments are in order. In all cases where we label the topic simply with ``migration", without specifying whether it refers to internal or international migration, it is because both forms are considered within the topic. Topics 2, 6, and 19 are strictly about theoretical frameworks and economic modelling. While topics 2 and 19 are related to both internal (sometimes treated as interregional migration in the literature) and international migration, topic 6 is predominantly about international migration, related to theoretical works that model the economic effects/impacts of immigration, such as the impact in the labor market for native workers, or the welfare effects for immigrants. Topics 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 18, 23, and 25 are exclusively about international migration subjects, while topics 20 and 21 have very strong international migration content, but might be associated with internal migration\footnote{For instance, topic 20 may be about internally displaced people (IDPs), while topic 21 may refer to internal remittances.}. Hence, following our hypothesis, we expect to see an increase in the participation of these topics. Topics 3 and 7 were labelled as ``selected topics" because neither his words nor the works related to them seem to define any specific topic. Topic 4 has words related to irregular migration and health-related issues (some papers belonging to this topic are even related to both), and it seems to be heavily focused on the US. Topics 8 and 16 are heavily skewed toward China, with the latter related to many works dealing with Chinese rural-urban migration (the 18th most likely word in this topic is ``hukou"). Topic 20 can be found in the literature as ``forced migration", but this terminology is outdated. Topic 21 is related to many works dealing with income inequality and poverty. Finally, the works related to topic 25 make many references to return migration.

To investigate how the field of \textit{economics of migration} has evolved in terms of its topical composition, we track the trend in topic proportions, as described in section \ref{methodology}. First, as presented in figure \ref{fig:topics_posterior}, we observe the trends in the topics by aggregating the average posterior probabilities over three periods: 1991-2002, 2003-2013, and 2014-2024. The most noticeable change over the three periods is a convergence of topics proportions, evidenced by the narrowing of the mean posterior probability interval.

From figure \ref{fig:topics_posterior1991}, we can see that the three with the highest participation in the period 1991-2002 were topics 2, 6, and 19, with topic 2 reaching a proportion of approximately 14\%; for instance, this value means that, if a scientific work on the field of \textit{economics of migration} were to be written during this period, there is a probability of 14\% that this work would be about topic 2, which is a considerable value given a pool of 26 topics. Next come topics 15 and 17, which we have identified as having a strong orientation toward internal migration. Although topic 2 remains the most prevalent in the second period, as shown by figure \ref{fig:topics_posterior2003}, topics 6, 7, 23, and 25 follow closely, which are all predominantly about international migration. Besides, other 13 topics boosted their participation during the second period, which indicates an increase in the literature's diversity. By our last period, between 2014 and 2024, we can see from figure \ref{fig:topics_posterior2014} that 23 of our 26 topics fall in a range of proportions between 2 and 5\%, and that out of the five topics with the highest participations, that is, topics 23, 10, 3, 7, and 18, only topic 3 is not exclusively about international migration.

\label{fig:topics_posterior}
\end{figure}

The most noticeable change over the three periods is the convergence of topics proportions, evidenced by the narrowing of the mean posterior probability interval. Perhaps the best way to visualize this convergence is by plotting the mean posterior probability year by year, as presented in figures \ref{fig:topic_trends_1} and \ref{fig:topic_trends_2}. The convergence of topics proportions means that, if a scientific paper in the field of \textit{economics of migration} were to be written today, the probability of it being written in any of the 26 topics would not change much, with a few exceptions. One possible explanation for this convergence is that the collection of documents we used to estimate our LDA topic model has become more diverse over the course of the 21st century.

\end{figure}

In summary, we can conclude that, in fact, some topics strongly related to international migration, especially topics 9, 10, 18, and 20, have increased considerably their participation in the 21st century, especially topic 18. On the other hand, topics with strong orientation toward internal migration, such as topics 1, 15, 16, and 17, have dropped off the research agenda. Therefore, the evidence shown does not allow us to reject the hypothesis that topics related to internal migration have lost importance, making way for topics related to international migration to increase their participation. Furthermore, the convergence in topic proportions may indicate that the field of \textit{economics of migration} has become more diverse, that is, the field is no longer as concentrated on a few topics, as was relatively the case in the period between 1991 and 2002.

\subsection{Diversity indices} \label{results_diversity_indices}

Motivated by \cite{pisarevskaya_mapping_2020}, we decided to test quantitatively if the field of \textit{economics of migration} has indeed become more diverse by presenting two diversity indices, the Gini-Simpson and the Shannon-Wiener entropy indices\footnote{A more detailed presentation of both indices can be found in the appendix \ref{diversity_indices}.}, where the higher their values, the greater the diversity. As can be seen in figures \ref{fig:gini_simpson_entropy} and \ref{fig:shannon_wiener_entropy}, both of our indices show that diversity in our corpus increased considerably between 1991 and 2009, reaching high levels of diversity\footnote{This result contrasts with that found by \cite[p. 467]{pisarevskaya_mapping_2020} in their analysis of diversity in the field of migration studies.}, which have remained relatively stable since then. Thus, referring back to figure \ref{topics_posterior}, the actual increase in diversity in our collection of documents took place between the first and second periods.
