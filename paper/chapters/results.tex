\subsection{LDA topic model} \label{results_topic_model}

As discussed in Section \ref{data}, we ended up with a corpus of 7,386 abstracts. During the pre-processing of our text data, we removed some neutral words that came up frequently, such as ``migration", ``migrant", ``migrants", ``mobility", ``article", ``paper", ``study", ``research", and ``analysis". Additionally, we defined the following multi-word expressions we wanted to treat as a single term: ``human capital", ``brain drain", ``brain gain", ``foreign direct investment", ``european union", ``united states", ``united kingdom", ``climate change", ``health care", ``asylum seeker". This is an important step, as these multi-word expressions should be considered as they are, because the words that compose them, separately, even if they appear together in the topics, might make their interpretation challenging.

After pre-processing our data and creating the document-term matrix (DTM), we decided trim the terms that appeared less than 10 times, in order to keep only the most essential words that could be identified as being part of a topic. In the end, we were left with 3,748 words that made up our fixed vocabulary. Thus, our DTM--as illustrated in Table \ref{tab:dtm}--is defined as a matrix of 7,386 rows and 3,748 columns. With that in hand, we estimate our LDA topic model with $K = 26$ topics, a number validated by the package  \textit{ldatuning}, and $\alpha = \frac{1}{K} \Leftrightarrow \alpha = 0.038$, which is a value that tells the algorithm that each document will be composed by a smaller number of very high-probability topics. For $\eta$\footnote{Just for the record, \textit{topicmodels} uses $\beta$ to define what we refer to here as $\eta$. In fact, this change in the notation of this hyperparameter is not unusual, as seen in \cite{ponweiser_latent_2012}.}, we used the default value of 0.1 given by the \textit{topicmodels}'s function \textit{LDA}. Tables \ref{tab:top_terms_1} and \ref{tab:top_terms_2} present the fifteen most likely terms from our 26 topics, which were taken from the matrix of per-topic word probabilities. As mentioned in Section \ref{topic_modelling}, LDA topic modelling is unable to assess and interpret topics qualitatively, meaning that it is one of our tasks to label the topics. To do that, we used a joint strategy of checking the twenty words with the highest probability in each topic and checking the ten works that are most likely to belong to each topic. We present the labels for the 26 topics in Table \ref{tab:topics_labels}.

We will not address all the topics, but some comments are in order. In all cases where we label the topic simply with ``migration", without specifying whether it refers to internal or international migration, it's because both forms are considered within the topic. Topics 2, 6, and 19 are strictly about theoretical frameworks and economic modelling. Considering the importance these topics had throughout the 20th century, it is expected that they will play a greater role in this period. Topics 7, 9, 10, 11, 18, 23, and 25 are exclusively about international migration, while Topic 21 has a very strong international migration content\footnote{The only reason why we do not classify this topic as being exclusively about international migration as well is because even though most remittances are sent abroad, we found cases that investigated domestic remittances.}. Hence, following our hypothesis, we expect to see an increase in the participation of these topics. Topics 3 and 7 were labelled as ``selected topics" because neither his words nor the works related to them seem to define any specific topic. Topic 4 has words related to irregular migration and health-related issues (some papers belonging to this topic are even related to both), and it seems to be heavily focused on the US. Topics 8 and 16 are heavily skewed toward China, with the latter related to many works dealing with Chinese rural-urban migration (the 18th most likely word in this topic is ``hukou"). Topic 20 can be found in the literature as ``forced migration", but this terminology is outdated. Topic 21 is related to many works dealing with income inequality and poverty. Finally, the works related to Topic 25 make many references to return migration.

As defined in Section \ref{methodology}, to investigate how the field of \textit{economics of migration} has evolved in terms of its topical composition, we used trend topic analysis with the topic proportions. First, we visualize the trends in the topics by aggregating the average posterior probabilities over three periods, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:topics_posterior}. The periods defined are 1991-2002, 2003-2013, and 2014-2024. We can see from Figure \ref{fig:topics_posterior1991} that Topics 2, 6, and 19 were the three with the highest participations in the period 1991-2002, with Topic 2 representing a proportion of approximately 14\%; this means that, if a scientific work on the field of \textit{economics of migration} were to be written during this period, there's a probability of 14\% that this work would be about Topic 2, which is a huge value in a pool of 26 topics. This is a results that we expected to see given the evidence provided in our literature review in Section \ref{lit_review}. However, the second period already shows a convergence in our topic proportions, although Topic 2 remains the most prevalent. By our last period, between 2014 and 2024, 23 of our 26 topics have proportions below 5\%, with the five topics with the highest participation in the literature being Topics 23, 10, 3, 7, and 18, the latter with a proportion of approximately 6.9\%. Out of these, only Topic 3 is not exclusively about international migration, which again confirms our expectations.

The convergence of topic proportions we see in Figure \ref{fig:topics_posterior} can be better visualized plotting the mean posterior probabilities in a continuous time, like in Figures \ref{fig:topic_trends_1} and \ref{fig:topic_trends_2}. This convergence means in the mean posterior probability means that, if a scientific paper in the field of \textit{economics of migration} were to be produced today, it would be equally likely to be written on any of our 26 topics, which is a result that is only possible because the corpus we use to fit our LDA topic model is currently fairly diverse. However, our trend topic analysis shows that this was not always the case, especially in the period 1991-2002. Therefore, we see this convergence as an increase in the diversity in the field's topical structure, which confirms our hypothesis.

\subsection{Diversity indices} \label{results_diversity_indices}

In order to validate the results of our trend topic analysis, we present two diversity indices, the Gini-Simpson and the Shannon-Wiener entropy indices, where the higher the values of both indices, the greater the diversity. As can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:gini_simpson_entropy} and \ref{fig:shannon_wiener_entropy}, both of our indices show that diversity in our corpus increased considerably between 1991 and 2009, reaching high levels of diversity, which have remained relatively stable since then. This result contrasts with that found by \cite[p. 467]{pisarevskaya_mapping_2020} in their analysis of diversity in the field of migration studies.
